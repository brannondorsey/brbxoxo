#brbxoxo questions

- Does the site need to use dropbox or can a simple drag and drop ftp like fetch or cyberduck work? (Basically a dropbox that you have to sign in to use)
- Should it be responsive?
- Who are you going to host through? I suggest bluehost but anything would be fine. Could I get the server info whenever you guys set that up?

#girls_vs_root

- Where do we stand for girls vs. github?
- Github has been making a lot of changes so why don't we see if we could at least roll out one a finished copy now with documentation so that if they do a redo anytime soon at least we have something?
